This is an example Quarto document. Note the `qmd` extension - this tells Quarto that this is a Markdown files that contains computations.

Since Quarto based on Markdown, we can **bold** and *italicize* text. We can also make headers.

# Let's make a table

|   Meal    |    Food     |
|:---------:|:-----------:|
| Breakfast |   Coffee    |
|   Lunch   |  Leftovers  |
|  Dinner   | Spam Musubi |

# Example images

Quarto supports an easy to use syntax for arranging figures on a page. For example, this layout:

    :::{layout="[[1], [1, 1]]"}
    ...
    :::

...will render as:

::: {layout="[[1], [1, 1]]"}
![Breakfast: Coffee](images/vic.jpg "Breakfast: Vietnamese iced coffee")

![Lunch: Leftovers](images/leftovers.jpg "Leftovers fried rice? Fried rice leftovers? Leftover-flavored fried rice?"){width="400"}

![Dinner: Spam musubi](images/spam_musubi.jpg "Oh mama we eating good tonight"){width="400"}

# Code and chunk options

Quarto is based on **R**Markdown, so you can do all the R stuff you're used to as well.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: "Standard curves for the LAMPS crop priming experiment"
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Read in and visualize crop priming data"
#| label: fig-std-curves


library(tidyverse)

standard_curves <- readxl::read_xlsx('data/std_curve.xlsx', sheet = "everything") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(amoa < 40)

lm_eqn = function(df){
    m = lm(log_qty ~ ct, df);
    data.frame(
      a = format(as.numeric(coef(m)[1]), digits = 2),
      b = format(as.numeric(coef(m)[2]), digits = 2),
      r2 = format(summary(m)$r.squared, digits = 3)
    )
}

st_splits <-  standard_curves %>% 
  group_by(amoa, run) %>% 
  group_split() 

eqs <- st_splits %>% 
  lapply(., lm_eqn) %>% 
  bind_rows()

labels <- lapply(st_splits, slice_head, n = 1) %>% 
  bind_rows() %>% 
  select(amoa, run) %>% 
  bind_cols(eqs) %>% 
  mutate(amoa = paste0("amoA_AOB_p", amoa)) %>%
  mutate(eq_label = paste0("y = ", a, " - ", abs(as.numeric(b)), "x<br>r^2 = ", r2))


standard_curves %>% 
  mutate(amoa = paste0("amoA_AOB_p", amoa)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(log_qty, ct)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(run ~ amoa, scales = "free") + 
  theme(
    panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", size = 1, fill = NA),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = "gray", size = 0.5, linetype = "dashed"),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "gray", size = 0.5, linetype = "dashed"),
    panel.spacing = unit(0.5, "lines"),
    panel.background = element_blank(),
    strip.background = element_rect(color = "black", size = 1, fill = NA),
  ) + 
  labs(
    x = "Log(gene copies per reaction)",
    y = "Ct"
  ) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 7), breaks = seq(0, 7, 1), expand = c(0, 0)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 25)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(group=1), method="lm", se=FALSE) + 
  ggtext::geom_richtext(data = labels, aes(x = 3, y = 5, label = eq_label),
                        size = 4, fontface = "bold", inherit.aes = FALSE)
```

We can also throw some Python in here:

```{python}
xs = [x for x in range(10)]

print(*(f'{x} squared is {x ^ 2}.' for x in xs), sep='\n')
```

```{python}
#| label: fig-tiles
#| fig-cap: "A good ol' heatmap."
#| code-fold: true

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

Z = np.random.rand(6, 10)
x = [x + 0.5 for x in xs]
y = np.arange(4.5, 11, 1)  

fig, ax = plt.subplots();
ax.pcolormesh(x, y, Z)
```

## Math stuff

We can also write math stuff! For example, here is a definition:

::: {#def-cont-at-a-point .demo-def}
## Continuity

The function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ is *continuous at a point* $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ if for all $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $\delta > 0$ such that if $|x - x_0| < \delta$, then $|f(x) - f(x_0)| < \varepsilon$. If this is true for all such $x$ in the domain of $f$, we say that $f$ is a *continuous function.*
:::

::: {#exercise-1}
## Example

Define $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ by:

$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
1, x \in \mathbb{Q},\\
0, x \not\in \mathbb{Q}
\end{cases}
$$

Prove that $f$ is not a continuous function.
:::

**Proof.** Let $\varepsilon = \frac{1}{2}$ and choose any $x \in \mathbb{Q}$. For any $\delta > 0$, we can find some $c \not\in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $|x - c| < \delta$ since the irrationals are dense in $\mathbb{R}$. But then $|f(x) - f(c)| = |1 - 0| = 1 > \frac{1}{2}$, showing that $f$ is not continuous at $x$. $\blacksquare$

## Adding references

We can also add references. For instance, the following definition of $k$-partially colored comes from this paper: [@blair2020]

::: {#def-merid-coloring .demo-def}
## $k$-partially colored

Let $D$ be a diagram of a link $L$ with $n$ crossings. We call $D$ $k$-*partially colored* if we have specified a subset $A$ of the strands of $D$ and a function $f:\to \{1, 2, \dots, k\}$. We refer to this partial coloring by the tuple $(A, f)$. Given $k$-partial colorings $(A_1, f_1)$ and $(A_2, f_2)$ of $D$, we say $(A_2, f_2)$ is the result of a coloring move on $(A_1, f_1)$ if

1.  $A_1 \subset A_2$ and $A_2 \ A_1 = \{s_j\}$ for some strand $s_j$ in $D$;
2.  $f_2|_{A_1} = f_1$;
3.  $s_j$ is adjacent to $s_i$ at some crossing $c \in v(D)$, and $s_i \in A_1$;
4.  the over-strand $s_k$ at $c$ is an element of $A_1$;
5.  $f_1(s_i) = f_2(s_j)$.
:::

## Cross-references

Along the way, we've been giving each of the items above labels. The Visual Editor knows about these labels and we can call them up for cross referencing. For example:

-   We were pretty happy about the standard curves in @fig-std-curves

-   I love heatmaps like @fig-tiles

-   @def-merid-coloring is trivially true for the unknot.
