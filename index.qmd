This is an example Quarto project made for the Reproducible Research with R workshop at the R/Medicine conference on 8/25/2021. 

This is a Quarto `book` project. A `book` project is just like a site, so it uses the same styling and structure as the `site`, but it has a few extra things. 
Most notably, you're able to download the entire site as a single document by clicking the download button in the upper right hand corner.
